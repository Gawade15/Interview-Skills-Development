# __Give real life implementation of Stack and Queue__

Stacks and queues are commonly used data structures with real-life implementations:

**Stack:**
A stack can be thought of as a collection of items where the last item added is the first one to be removed, following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. 
An everyday example is the call stack in computer programming. When you call a function, it's added to the stack. The function at the top is the one currently being executed, and when it's done, it's removed. This is crucial for tracking function calls and memory allocation.

**Queue:**
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first item added is the first one to be removed. 
Think of a queue at a ticket counter, where the person who arrives first is the first to get a ticket. In computing, task scheduling, print spooling, and handling requests in web servers all use queues. For example, when you print multiple documents, they are processed in the order they were added to the print queue.
